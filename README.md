# Hi there, I'm Abdurrab Khan 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Data Specialist who builds the systems that move data and the analysis that makes sense of it. I focus on engineering clean, scalable pipelines while keeping a sharp eye on the actual insights that drive a product forward. With a solid background in stakeholder strategy, I’m just as comfortable diving into complex code as I am translating technical data into clear wins for the business.
